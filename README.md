# Erlang Snippets for VIM.

Here are snippets that I use for Erlang.
The file templates were originally generated via emacs and modified.

## ToDo

1.  automate generation of file templates whenever there is a new Erlang
    release.
2.  investigate whether snippmate can recursively include other snippets.
